**Repository**: https://github.com/TheCaptainFu/BreakTheCode  
**Status**: Production-ready, awaiting domain deployment  

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for multiplayer functionality
- **Security**: Helmet.js, rate limiting, input validation, CORS protection
- **Port**: 3000 (configurable via environment variable)
- **Session Management**: In-memory room and player management

### Frontend Architecture
- **UI Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with class-based architecture
- **Design System**: Glassmorphism with CSS custom properties
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO client for game state synchronization

### Game Logic Architecture
- **Turn-based System**: Server-side turn validation and management
- **Room Management**: 6-character alphanumeric room codes
- **Player Capacity**: 2 players per room maximum
- **Game States**: waiting ‚Üí setup ‚Üí playing ‚Üí finished

## üîß Code Patterns & Conventions

### Server-Side Patterns
```javascript
// Room structure pattern
const room = {
    code: roomCode,
    players: {},
    gameState: 'waiting', // waiting, setup, playing, finished
    guesses: {},
    winner: null,
    currentTurn: null,
    turnCount: 0,
    createdAt: new Date()
};

// Player structure pattern
const player = {
    id: socket.id,
    name: playerName,
    secretNumber: null,
    ready: false,
    guesses: [],
    score: 0
};
```

### Client-Side Patterns
```javascript
// Game state management pattern
this.gameState = {
    currentScreen: 'welcome',
    playerName: '',
    roomCode: '',
    isHost: false,
    secretNumber: '',
    guesses: [],
    opponentGuesses: [],
    gameStatus: 'waiting',
    isMyTurn: false,
    currentTurn: null
};
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: camelCase (playerName, roomCode, gameState)
- **Functions**: camelCase with descriptive verbs (createRoom, validateGuess, handleGameEnd)
- **CSS Classes**: kebab-case with BEM-like structure (player-card, guess-inputs, turn-indicator)
- **Socket Events**: camelCase (roomCreated, gameStart, makeGuess, playAgain, rejoinRoom)

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies & Versions

### Production Dependencies
```json
{
  "express": "^4.18.2",
  "socket.io": "^4.7.2",
  "helmet": "^7.0.0",
  "express-rate-limit": "^6.8.1",
  "cors": "^2.8.5"
}
```

### Development Setup
- **Node.js**: v22.15.0 (verified working)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Git**: Repository initialized and connected to GitHub

## üêõ Challenges Solved

### 1. Wrong Place Digit Calculation (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: Algorithm incorrectly counted digits in wrong places
**Root Cause**: Single-pass algorithm caused double counting of digits
**Solution**: Implemented two-pass algorithm:
```javascript
// First pass: Mark correct positions
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    if (secretStr[i] === guessStr[i]) {
        correctPlace++;
        secretUsed[i] = true;
        guessUsed[i] = true;
    }
}

// Second pass: Count wrong positions from unused digits
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    if (!guessUsed[i]) {
        for (let j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
            if (!secretUsed[j] && secretStr[j] === guessStr[i]) {
                wrongPlace++;
                secretUsed[j] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Turn-Based Implementation
**Challenge**: Converting simultaneous gameplay to turn-based
**Solution**: 
- Added `currentTurn` and `turnCount` to room state
- Server-side validation prevents out-of-turn actions
- Client-side UI updates based on turn state
- Automatic turn switching after each guess

### 3. Play Again Functionality (CRITICAL FIX) ‚≠ê *NEW*
**Problem**: Play Again button didn't work - only reset client state, not server state
**Root Cause**: No server-side communication for game reset
**Solution**: 
- Added `playAgain` socket event on server
- Server properly resets room state while preserving scores
- Client sends request to server instead of local reset
- Added `newRoundStarted` event for synchronized state reset

### 4. Connection Stability Issues (CRITICAL FIX) ‚≠ê *NEW*
**Problem**: Frequent "lost connection" messages during gameplay
**Root Cause**: Poor Socket.IO configuration and missing reconnection logic
**Solution**:
- Enhanced Socket.IO configuration with proper timeouts:
```javascript
const io = socketIo(server, {
    pingTimeout: 60000,
    pingInterval: 25000,
    upgradeTimeout: 30000,
    maxHttpBufferSize: 1e6
});
```
- Added robust reconnection logic on client:
```javascript
this.socket = io({
    reconnection: true,
    reconnectionDelay: 1000,
    reconnectionDelayMax: 5000,
    maxReconnectionAttempts: 5,
    timeout: 20000,
    forceNew: true
});
```
- Implemented `rejoinRoom` functionality for seamless game continuation after reconnection

### 5. UI/UX Display Issues (CRITICAL FIX) ‚≠ê *NEW*
**Problems**: 
- Opponent name showing as "Opponent" instead of actual nickname
- Player status incorrectly showing "Ready!" when not ready
- "New Game" button not working properly after completing a game

**Solutions**:
- **Opponent Name Display**: Added `opponentName` tracking in game state and proper extraction from server data
- **Player Status Accuracy**: Fixed `updateRoomDisplay` to properly check `player.ready` status before showing "Ready!"
- **New Game Functionality**: Added proper room cleanup with `leaveRoom` event and complete state reset

### 6. Player Card Display Issues (CRITICAL FIX) ‚≠ê *NEW*
**Problems**:
- "Host" showing instead of actual opponent nickname when pressing "Play Again"
- Player's own nickname appearing on both sides after "New Game" ‚Üí "Create Room"
- Inconsistent player card states between game sessions

**Solutions**:
- **Play Again Display**: Fixed `showRoomScreen` to not hardcode "Host" and properly clear player cards
- **New Game State Reset**: Enhanced `resetToWelcome` to completely clear opponent name and player card displays
- **Player Card Management**: Added `clearPlayerCards()` function and improved `updatePlayerCard()` to handle empty names
- **Server Room Updates**: Added proper room state broadcasts on room creation and updates

### 7. Missing Dependencies Error
**Problem**: "Cannot find module 'express'" errors
**Solution**: Ensured `npm install` is run before server start
**Prevention**: Added clear setup instructions in deployment guides

### 8. UI State Management
**Challenge**: Keeping UI synchronized with game state
**Solution**: Centralized game state object with dedicated update methods
**Pattern**: Single source of truth with reactive UI updates

## üé® Performance Optimizations

### Client-Side Optimizations
1. **Efficient DOM Updates**: Targeted element updates instead of full re-renders
2. **Event Debouncing**: Auto-advance inputs with proper event handling
3. **CSS Animations**: Hardware-accelerated transforms and opacity changes
4. **Image Optimization**: Icon fonts instead of image assets

### Server-Side Optimizations
1. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old rooms (30-minute timeout)
2. **Connection Handling**: Graceful disconnect handling
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and ensures fair resource usage
4. **Input Validation**: Early validation to prevent unnecessary processing

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

### Breakpoints
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (full layout)
- **Tablet**: 768px-1023px (adjusted spacing)
- **Mobile**: <768px (stacked layout)
- **Small Mobile**: <480px (compact inputs)

### Mobile-Specific Features
- Touch-friendly input sizes (minimum 44px)
- Simplified navigation

- Reduced animation complexity on mobile

## üîí Security Implementation

### Input Sanitization
```javascript
function isValidPlayerName(name) {
    if (typeof name !== 'string') return false;
    const trimmed = name.trim();
    return trimmed.length >= 2 && 
           trimmed.length <= 20 &&
           /^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-_]+$/.test(trimmed);
}
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration
```javascript
const gameActionLimiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
    max: 30, // 30 actions per minute
    message: 'Too many game actions, please slow down.'
});

## üéÆ Game Rules & Mechanics

### Objective
Players must guess their opponent's 4-digit secret number using feedback from previous guesses.

2. Players alternate turns after each guess
3. Only the current player can submit guesses
4. Turn indicator shows whose turn it is

### Win Condition
First player to guess all 4 digits in correct positions wins the game.
