## 🎮 Game Overview

**Break The Code** is an electrifying 2-player real-time number guessing battle where strategy meets luck! Each player creates a secret 4-digit code and races to crack their opponent's number first. With every guess, you'll receive crucial feedback to guide your next move:

- 🎯 **Correct Place**: Right digit in the right position
- 🔄 **Wrong Place**: Right digit but in the wrong position

### 🏆 Example Round

Your Guess:    4326
Result:        1 correct place, 1 wrong place
